# MicroK8

All applications hosted on the `homelab` are deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster is managed by [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/), a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that runs on a single node. MicroK8s is a great choice for homelabs because it is easy to install and manage, and it is resource-efficient.
